% In robotic navigation and exploration, there is a need to investigate efficent methods to handle continous state and control spaces. Many contributions have proposed variations of RRT algorithms that can more efficiently handle these enviroments over an Markov Decision Process (MDP). In this paper, we propose a method that expands on a proposed RRT variant that incorporates behvior cloning (BC) and utilizes a visual classifier to learn the cost function of the optimal trajectories.

\section{Introduction}

Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (RRT) \cite{Steven} have proven to be a very useful sample-based path-planning algorithm to efficiently search high-dimensional spaces. However, RRT can be hindered in environments with obstacles or specific pathways to a goal. The algorithm may waste time exploring down irrelevant or blocked paths. In this paper, we will survey various learning approaches to problems encountered by RRT in such environments, evaluate a baseline modified RRT algorithm based on behavior cloning, present our experiment results and discuss our future work. 

\section{Problem Statement}

% TODO Finish problem statement
A basic RRT algorithm's performance can suffer in configuration spaces with obstacles by exploring down irrelevant or blocked paths. The surveyed learning improvements to RRT may help but they still need a way to discover where the goal states and relevant obstacles are in relation to the agent. This problem can arise a variety of different domains such as expansions through mazes, robotic control in constrained spaces \cite{9164659}, and systems testing of multi-step processes \cite{Zuo}.


\section{Related Work}

In the last few years, several contributions to robotic navigation and exploration have been proposed that incorporate variations of sampling-based costmap planners, such as RRT or RRT*, and learning from demonstrations. Zuo et. al. \cite{Zuo} proposes a method, Clone Assisted RRT (CA-RRT), that learns heuristics for a search-based algorithm from a limited number of human demonstrations. CA-RRT is an expansion of the human-seeded RRT (HS-RRT) proposed by Chang et. al. \cite{Chang}, which uses states from human demonstrations as seed configurations states within an RRT. This expansion includes adding a first-person image-state-based (behavioral) cloning approach over the HS-RRT. Zuo et. al. \cite{Zuo} method consists of collecting a set of human-created trajectories and training a behavioral cloning policy using the first-person state-action pairs from those trajectories to seed the RRT. These heuristics allow the search algorithms to automatically test other states in the game thus removing the necessity to test all possible scenarios in the game through human game play.

Perez et. al. \cite{Perez} also proposes an approach to learn navigation behaviors from demonstrations with the use of sampling-based costmap planners, though they propose the use Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) concepts to identify the RRT cost function that best fits the example trajectories. The proposed method, Rapidly-exploring random Trees Inverse Reinforcement Learning (RTIRL), makes use of the RRT* instead of a Markov Decision Process (MDP). This is due to the advantages that RRT* has over MDP, in which RRT* can handle continuous state and control spaces. Perez et. al. \cite{Perez} RTIRL method is used to extract the proper weights of the cost function from demonstration trajectories, which can then be used later in the RRT* process to allow the robot to reproduce the desired behavior at various scenarios. 

Both papers propose learning algorithms that use sampling-based costmap planners for path planning and exploration. Our proposed method will also be expanding upon the RRT algorithm and involve collecting and utilizing human demonstrations to allow for learning from demonstrations. Our proposed algorithm will incorporate a similar behavior cloning (BC) approach to that of Zuo et. al. \cite{Zuo} as the BC policy will be act as a seed in the initial RRT configuration. In addition to BC, we aim to use a visual classifier to learn a cost function, by using an image to gather samples from various locations to determine the cost to reach the goal state. This approach is similar to Perez et. al. \cite{Perez} proposed method, which adjusts and learns a cost function of the RRT* planner.


\section{Problem Domain}

Currently, the problem domain consists primarily of 2D pygame environment which contains static obstacles that create a maze that the agent must navigate. As of the baseline presentation, the static 2D environment consists of 9 static obstacles, a static start point and a static goal point. The start is in the upper left corner of the 2D environment and the current static goal is on the far right of the screen on the other side of all of the obstacles.

For our problem the agent is creating a path to navigate from start to goal. In order to do this, our agent uses an RRT algorithm.

Due to the static nature of the 2D environment as it stands now, our agent is being tested in a discrete space as the size and number of possible x,y coordinates the agent can be in is static at 500x800 pixels.

\section{Learning Baseline}
To create a baseline for our CARRT, we require a demonstration. As we planned to use static obstacle space, we ignored the location of obstacles in creating the demo.
We used pygame to set up our environment and demonstrations were collected by us playing the game using WASD keys. Each demonstration is a trajectory with (state, action) pairs. Each state is represented as (the current position of the agent, goal position) and action is represented as ENUM of WASD keys.
We used a simple MLP model as a prediction/action generator, a summary of the model is given in Table 1.
For the next phase of the project, we'll keep this model as a baseline and expand it to accommodate dynamic world state space.

  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Experiment Metrics}

Our baseline performance was measured using 3 metrics:
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Success Rate: The percentage of times out of n samples that the agent successfully reaches the goal.}
	\item{Time: The time (s) taken from the start of RRT to termination due to either reaching the iteration limit or reaching the goal.}
	\item{Number of Expansions: The number of nodes in the RRT graph at termination.}
\end{itemize}

\section{Experiment Results}
% Detail result findings
As our final goal is to create a RRT algorithm that uses a visual classifier as a cost function for our baseline, we needed a learning RRT baseline rather than just standard RRT for the baseline. Because of this, metrics were taken for both our baseline algorithm (our version of CA-RRT) and a normal RRT algorithm. In order to ensure our baseline was functioning correctly, we must see an improvement of our BCRRT over the base RRT. We can see the metric results for RRT in Table \ref{RRT Metrics} as well as the BCRRT in Table \ref{BCRRT Metrics}, which show that as expected our baseline BCRRT algorithm performs better overall than the base RRT algorithm. In success rate, mean time, and mean expansion number, BCRRTperforms better over the different n sample tests than RRT with nothing added on. These results confirm our baseline is functioning well as we are seeing expected performance increases over RRT.

% including figures. Additional pages \emph{containing only acknowledgments and
% references} are allowed. Papers that exceed the page limit will not be
% reviewed, or in any other way considered for presentation at the conference.


% The margins in 2022 are the same as those in 2007, which allow for $\sim$$15\%$
% more words in the paper compared to earlier years.


% Authors are required to use the NeurIPS \LaTeX{} style files obtainable at the
% NeurIPS website as indicated below. Please make sure you use the current files
% and not previous versions. Tweaking the style files may be grounds for
% rejection.


% \subsection{Retrieval of style files}


% The style files for NeurIPS and other conference information are available on
% the World Wide Web at
% \begin{center}
%   \url{http://www.neurips.cc/}
% \end{center}
% The file \verb+neurips_2022.pdf+ contains these instructions and illustrates the
% various formatting requirements your NeurIPS paper must satisfy.


% The only supported style file for NeurIPS 2022 is \verb+neurips_2022.sty+,
% rewritten for \LaTeXe{}.  \textbf{Previous style files for \LaTeX{} 2.09,
%   Microsoft Word, and RTF are no longer supported!}


% The \LaTeX{} style file contains three optional arguments: \verb+final+, which
% creates a camera-ready copy, \verb+preprint+, which creates a preprint for
% submission to, e.g., arXiv, and \verb+nonatbib+, which will not load the
% \verb+natbib+ package for you in case of package clash.


% \paragraph{Preprint option}
% If you wish to post a preprint of your work online, e.g., on arXiv, using the
% NeurIPS style, please use the \verb+preprint+ option. This will create a
% nonanonymized version of your work with the text ``Preprint. Work in progress.''
% in the footer. This version may be distributed as you see fit. Please \textbf{do
%   not} use the \verb+final+ option, which should \textbf{only} be used for
% papers accepted to NeurIPS.


% At submission time, please omit the \verb+final+ and \verb+preprint+
% options. This will anonymize your submission and add line numbers to aid
% review. Please do \emph{not} refer to these line numbers in your paper as they
% will be removed during generation of camera-ready copies.


% The file \verb+neurips_2022.tex+ may be used as a ``shell'' for writing your
% paper. All you have to do is replace the author, title, abstract, and text of
% the paper with your own.


% The formatting instructions contained in these style files are summarized in
% Sections \ref{gen_inst}, \ref{headings}, and \ref{others} below.


% \section{General formatting instructions}
% \label{gen_inst}


% The text must be confined within a rectangle 5.5~inches (33~picas) wide and
% 9~inches (54~picas) long. The left margin is 1.5~inch (9~picas).  Use 10~point
% type with a vertical spacing (leading) of 11~points.  Times New Roman is the
% preferred typeface throughout, and will be selected for you by default.
% Paragraphs are separated by \nicefrac{1}{2}~line space (5.5 points), with no
% indentation.


% The paper title should be 17~point, initial caps/lower case, bold, centered
% between two horizontal rules. The top rule should be 4~points thick and the
% bottom rule should be 1~point thick. Allow \nicefrac{1}{4}~inch space above and
% below the title to rules. All pages should start at 1~inch (6~picas) from the
% top of the page.


% For the final version, authors' names are set in boldface, and each name is
% centered above the corresponding address. The lead author's name is to be listed
% first (left-most), and the co-authors' names (if different address) are set to
% follow. If there is only one co-author, list both author and co-author side by
% side.


% Please pay special attention to the instructions in Section \ref{others}
% regarding figures, tables, acknowledgments, and references.


% \section{Headings: first level}
% \label{headings}


% All headings should be lower case (except for first word and proper nouns),
% flush left, and bold.


% First-level headings should be in 12-point type.


% \subsection{Headings: second level}


% Second-level headings should be in 10-point type.


% \subsubsection{Headings: third level}


% Third-level headings should be in 10-point type.


% \paragraph{Paragraphs}


% There is also a \verb+\paragraph+ command available, which sets the heading in
% bold, flush left, and inline with the text, with the heading followed by 1\,em
% of space.


% \section{Citations, figures, tables, references}
% \label{others}


% These instructions apply to everyone.


% \subsection{Citations within the text}


% The \verb+natbib+ package will be loaded for you by default.  Citations may be
% author/year or numeric, as long as you maintain internal consistency.  As to the
% format of the references themselves, any style is acceptable as long as it is
% used consistently.


% The documentation for \verb+natbib+ may be found at
% \begin{center}
%   \url{http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/natbib/natnotes.pdf}
% \end{center}
% Of note is the command \verb+\citet+, which produces citations appropriate for
% use in inline text.  For example,
% \begin{verbatim}
%    \citet{hasselmo} investigated\dots
% \end{verbatim}
% produces
% \begin{quote}
%   Hasselmo, et al.\ (1995) investigated\dots
% \end{quote}


% If you wish to load the \verb+natbib+ package with options, you may add the
% following before loading the \verb+neurips_2022+ package:
% \begin{verbatim}
%    \PassOptionsToPackage{options}{natbib}
% \end{verbatim}


% If \verb+natbib+ clashes with another package you load, you can add the optional
% argument \verb+nonatbib+ when loading the style file:
% \begin{verbatim}
%    \usepackage[nonatbib]{neurips_2022}
% \end{verbatim}


% As submission is double blind, refer to your own published work in the third
% person. That is, use ``In the previous work of Jones et al.\ [4],'' not ``In our
% previous work [4].'' If you cite your other papers that are not widely available
% (e.g., a journal paper under review), use anonymous author names in the
% citation, e.g., an author of the form ``A.\ Anonymous.''


% \subsection{Footnotes}


% Footnotes should be used sparingly.  If you do require a footnote, indicate
% footnotes with a number\footnote{Sample of the first footnote.} in the
% text. Place the footnotes at the bottom of the page on which they appear.
% Precede the footnote with a horizontal rule of 2~inches (12~picas).


% Note that footnotes are properly typeset \emph{after} punctuation
% marks.\footnote{As in this example.}


% \subsection{Figures}


% \begin{figure}
%   \centering
%   \fbox{\rule[-.5cm]{0cm}{4cm} \rule[-.5cm]{4cm}{0cm}}
%   \caption{Sample figure caption.}
% \end{figure}


% All artwork must be neat, clean, and legible. Lines should be dark enough for
% purposes of reproduction. The figure number and caption always appear after the
% figure. Place one line space before the figure caption and one line space after
% the figure. The figure caption should be lower case (except for first word and
% proper nouns); figures are numbered consecutively.


% You may use color figures.  However, it is best for the figure captions and the
% paper body to be legible if the paper is printed in either black/white or in
% color.


% \subsection{Tables}


% All tables must be centered, neat, clean and legible.  The table number and
% title always appear before the table.  See Table~\ref{sample-table}.


% Place one line space before the table title, one line space after the
% table title, and one line space after the table. The table title must
% be lower case (except for first word and proper nouns); tables are
% numbered consecutively.


% Note that publication-quality tables \emph{do not contain vertical rules.} We
% strongly suggest the use of the \verb+booktabs+ package, which allows for
% typesetting high-quality, professional tables:
% \begin{center}
%   \url{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/booktabs}
% \end{center}
% This package was used to typeset Table~\ref{sample-table}.


% \begin{table}
%   \caption{Sample table title}
%   \label{sample-table}
%   \centering
%   \begin{tabular}{lll}
%     \toprule
%     \multicolumn{2}{c}{Part}                   \\
%     \cmidrule(r){1-2}
%     Name     & Description     & Size ($\mu$m) \\
%     \midrule
%     Dendrite & Input terminal  & $\sim$100     \\
%     Axon     & Output terminal & $\sim$10      \\
%     Soma     & Cell body       & up to $10^6$  \\
%     \bottomrule
%   \end{tabular}
% \end{table}


% \section{Final instructions}


% Do not change any aspects of the formatting parameters in the style files.  In
% particular, do not modify the width or length of the rectangle the text should
% fit into, and do not change font sizes (except perhaps in the
% \textbf{References} section; see below). Please note that pages should be
% numbered.


% \section{Preparing PDF files}


% Please prepare submission files with paper size ``US Letter,'' and not, for
% example, ``A4.''


% Fonts were the main cause of problems in the past years. Your PDF file must only
% contain Type 1 or Embedded TrueType fonts. Here are a few instructions to
% achieve this.


% \begin{itemize}


% \item You should directly generate PDF files using \verb+pdflatex+.


% \item You can check which fonts a PDF files uses.  In Acrobat Reader, select the
%   menu Files$>$Document Properties$>$Fonts and select Show All Fonts. You can
%   also use the program \verb+pdffonts+ which comes with \verb+xpdf+ and is
%   available out-of-the-box on most Linux machines.


% \item The IEEE has recommendations for generating PDF files whose fonts are also
%   acceptable for NeurIPS. Please see
%   \url{http://www.emfield.org/icuwb2010/downloads/IEEE-PDF-SpecV32.pdf}


% \item \verb+xfig+ "patterned" shapes are implemented with bitmap fonts.  Use
%   "solid" shapes instead.


% \item The \verb+\bbold+ package almost always uses bitmap fonts.  You should use
%   the equivalent AMS Fonts:
% \begin{verbatim}
%    \usepackage{amsfonts}
% \end{verbatim}
% followed by, e.g., \verb+\mathbb{R}+, \verb+\mathbb{N}+, or \verb+\mathbb{C}+
% for $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{N}$ or $\mathbb{C}$.  You can also use the following
% workaround for reals, natural and complex:
% \begin{verbatim}
%    \newcommand{\RR}{I\!\!R} %real numbers
%    \newcommand{\Nat}{I\!\!N} %natural numbers
%    \newcommand{\CC}{I\!\!\!\!C} %complex numbers
% \end{verbatim}
% Note that \verb+amsfonts+ is automatically loaded by the \verb+amssymb+ package.


% \end{itemize}


% If your file contains type 3 fonts or non embedded TrueType fonts, we will ask
% you to fix it.


% \subsection{Margins in \LaTeX{}}


% Most of the margin problems come from figures positioned by hand using
% \verb+\special+ or other commands. We suggest using the command
% \verb+\includegraphics+ from the \verb+graphicx+ package. Always specify the
% figure width as a multiple of the line width as in the example below:
% \begin{verbatim}
%    \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx} ...
%    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{myfile.pdf}
% \end{verbatim}
% See Section 4.4 in the graphics bundle documentation
% (\url{http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/required/graphics/grfguide.pdf})


% A number of width problems arise when \LaTeX{} cannot properly hyphenate a
% line. Please give LaTeX hyphenation hints using the \verb+\-+ command when
% necessary.


% \begin{ack}
% Use unnumbered first level headings for the acknowledgments. All acknowledgments
% go at the end of the paper before the list of references. Moreover, you are required to declare
% funding (financial activities supporting the submitted work) and competing interests (related financial activities outside the submitted work).
% More information about this disclosure can be found at: \url{https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2022/PaperInformation/FundingDisclosure}.


% Do {\bf not} include this section in the anonymized submission, only in the final paper. You can use the \texttt{ack} environment provided in the style file to autmoatically hide this section in the anonymized submission.
% \end{ack}

% \section*{Checklist}


% %%% BEGIN INSTRUCTIONS %%%
% The checklist follows the references.  Please
% read the checklist guidelines carefully for information on how to answer these
% questions.  For each question, change the default \answerTODO{} to \answerYes{},
% \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.  You are strongly encouraged to include a {\bf
% justification to your answer}, either by referencing the appropriate section of
% your paper or providing a brief inline description.  For example:
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item Did you include the license to the code and datasets? \answerYes{See Section~\ref{gen_inst}.}
%   \item Did you include the license to the code and datasets? \answerNo{The code and the data are proprietary.}
%   \item Did you include the license to the code and datasets? \answerNA{}
% \end{itemize}
% Please do not modify the questions and only use the provided macros for your
% answers.  Note that the Checklist section does not count towards the page
% limit.  In your paper, please delete this instructions block and only keep the
% Checklist section heading above along with the questions/answers below.
